# üöÄ Productivity Tracker Chrome Extension

As part of my internship at **CodTech IT Solutions**, I developed a full-stack **Productivity Tracker Chrome Extension**, designed to help users monitor and control their web browsing habits. This project combines browser-level tracking with a cloud-connected backend to offer users a practical tool for improving online focus. Built entirely using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), this extension captures real-time browsing activity, blocks distracting websites, and provides insightful usage analytics‚Äîallowing users to take charge of their productivity.

The project began with identifying a common problem: frequent distractions while using the internet, which can significantly reduce productivity. I approached the solution by designing a Chrome extension that not only records time spent on websites but also allows users to block specific domains and review their browsing patterns through clean, actionable reports.

On the **frontend**, I built the extension‚Äôs user interface using **React**, adapted specifically for **Chrome Extension Manifest V3** compliance. The popup UI includes key features such as a usage timer, a domain blocklist form, and alert feedback. To handle extension-specific behaviors like messaging and service workers, I used Chrome‚Äôs extension APIs and configured the app using **Vite**, which efficiently bundles the project into a Manifest V3-compatible build. The interface was designed for quick access and usability within the browser's toolbar.

The **backend** was implemented using **Node.js** and **Express**, forming a REST API that communicates with a **MongoDB** database. The server manages user-specific records, logs time spent on websites, and stores blocklist data. I designed endpoints to log domain visits, retrieve usage data over different time ranges (daily and weekly), and update or fetch each user‚Äôs personalized list of blocked websites.

To ensure data continuity across browsing sessions and even different devices, I introduced a **Device ID mechanism**. This allowed each browser instance to maintain a consistent link to the user‚Äôs activity in the database. Time tracking was handled in the background using Chrome's extension APIs‚Äîscripts monitored active browser tabs, tracked the time spent on each website, and sent this data to the backend at regular intervals.

The blocking feature was implemented by intercepting navigation attempts to any domain listed in the user‚Äôs blocklist. When such a domain is accessed, the extension automatically redirects the user to a custom **‚ÄúBlocked Page‚Äù**, discouraging access and reinforcing productive behavior.

Extensive testing was conducted to validate each feature. I simulated user behavior such as frequent tab switching, usage spikes, and blocklist changes. Reports were cross-verified with server logs to ensure accurate tracking and analytics. The system functioned reliably across different machines and browsers, offering consistent performance.

This project gave me real-world experience in **Chrome extension development**, integrating **React with browser APIs**, designing **RESTful services**, and working with **MongoDB** for time-based tracking. It also enhanced my understanding of syncing local browser activity with cloud databases to build responsive and intelligent productivity tools.
